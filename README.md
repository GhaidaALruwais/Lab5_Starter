## Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
No, I would not use a unit test to test the entire "message" feature because it involves multiple components that go beyond the scope of unit testing. We need to ensure that all parts of the system work together to successfully send a message from one user to another.

## Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? 
Yes, I would use a unit test for the "max message length" feature because it is a small, isolated piece of logic that can be tested independently.
